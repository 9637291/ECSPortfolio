  <h3>Performances</h3>
  <li>I have performed in church, for my family and friends, and I even got to play guitar in the
  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with a band. I take guitar lessons and every year I have a performace.</li>
       <h3>What I Like to Play</h3>
		<li>I love to learn all kinds of songs on guitar, but my favorite type of music is rock music. I enjoy 
		leaning songs from the 90's and 2000's. I like to play acoustic and electric guitar.
